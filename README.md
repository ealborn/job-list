# Simple Job-list

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## You can find a link to the live page here: [https://ealborn.github.io/job-list/](https://ealborn.github.io/job-list/)

### Steps to run locally:
This project was made with yarn, which I reccommend - it has not been tested with npm even though it should work.

- Clone the repository and make sure you are in the master branch.
- go into the folder named job-list
- run yarn install
- run yarn start and the project should boot up by itself, or go to http://localhost:3000 to see it.
